## Direct Sums and Complements 

---
**Definition** (Direct Sum): Let $V$ be a vector space over $F$, $W_1, W_2, \leq V$, $V$ is the direct sum of $W_1$ and $W_2$ if 

1. $V = W_1 + W_2$
2. $W_1 \cap W_2 = \{ 0 \} $

Denoted
$$
  V = W_1 \bigoplus W_2
$$

**Proposition** (Direct sum and unique representation): $V$ is a direct sum of $W_1$ and $W_2$ if and only if every element of $V$ can be written uniquely as 
$$
  v = w_1 + w_2, w_1 \in W_1, w_2 \in W_2
$$

**Proof**:

$(\implies)$:
